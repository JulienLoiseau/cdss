## [Information Science & Technology Institute (ISTI)](https://www.lanl.gov/projects/national-security-education-center/information-science-technology/)

Working closely with LANL's Information Science and Technology Center and line organizations across LANL, the Information Science and Technology Institute engages in, implements, and/or broadly fosters collaborative research, capability and workforce development, technical exchange, program development activities, and institutionally-focused strategic planning.

 The summer school receives half of its funding through the Information Science & Technology Institute.  The institute is lead by Stephan Eidenbenz.

## [Advanced Simulation & Computing (ASC) Program](http://nnsa.energy.gov/asc)

Established in 1995, the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Program supports the U.S. Defense Programs' shift in emphasis from test-based confidence to simulation-based confidence. Under ASC, computer simulation capabilities are developed to analyze and predict the performance, safety, and reliability of nuclear weapons and to certify their functionality.

The summer school receives half of its funding through the Computational Systems & Software Environment (CSSE) Program.  The program is managed by Mike Lang.
