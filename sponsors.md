## [Advanced Simulation & Computing (ASC) Program](http://nnsa.energy.gov/asc)

Established in 1995, the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Program supports the U.S. Defense Programs' shift in emphasis from test-based confidence to simulation-based confidence. Under ASC, computer simulation capabilities are developed to analyze and predict the performance, safety, and reliability of nuclear weapons and to certify their functionality.

The summer school receives three quarters of its funding through the Computational Systems & Software Environment (CSSE) Program.  The program is managed by Mike Lang.
