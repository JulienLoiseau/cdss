XCP-1 Lagrangian Applications

Chris is a computational scientist with a background in astrophysics. In particular, his interests lie in numerical modelling of astrophysical explosions driven by turbulent flow coupled to thermonuclear reactions, such as Type Ia supernovae and Type I X-ray bursts.  In recent years, his focus has been on high-energy physics in general, with applications and development on modern computing architectures.

### Marc Charest

XCP-1 Lagrangian Applications

Marc's current research focuses on developing highly-scalable algorithms for multi-material and multi-physics problems that are specifically designed for next-generation computer architectures.  More specifically, he is developing/implementing advanced remapping strategies for arbitrary polygonal meshes.  Prior research at LANL focused on developing high-order methods for Eulerian and ALE hydrodynamics that can be used in conjunction with adaptive mesh refinement and unstructured grids.
