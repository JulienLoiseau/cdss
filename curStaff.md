XCP-1 Lagrangian Applications

Marc's current research focuses on developing highly-scalable algorithms for multi-material and multi-physics problems that are specifically designed for next-generation computer architectures.  More specifically, he is developing/implementing advanced remapping strategies for arbitrary polygonal meshes.  Prior research at LANL focused on developing high-order methods for Eulerian and ALE hydrodynamics that can be used in conjunction with adaptive mesh refinement and unstructured grids. -->
