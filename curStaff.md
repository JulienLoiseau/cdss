HPC-ENV HPC Environments

Reid is a staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Prior to Los Alamos, he was a research staff member at IBM Research. He holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Minnesota and a B.A., also in computer science, from Macalester College.

His work focuses on large-scale data analysis from both systems and applications perspectives. Recent lines of research include using social media and web traffic to monitor and forecast the spread of disease as well as developing technology to bring data-intensive computing and user-defined software stacks to existing high-performance computing systems.

In his spare time, he enjoys reading, bicycling, hiking (especially in the mountains and deserts of the American West), tinkering with things, photography, and hanging out with his wife and sons.
